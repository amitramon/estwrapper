# __estwrapper__

**estwrapper** is a friendly front-end to
[Hyper Estraier](http://fallabs.com/hyperestraier/), a full-text
search system. It allows one to easily scan and index her documents,
thus creating a search-able database. This database can then be
searched either using a web interface powered by a CGI script provided
by Hyper Estraier, or from the command line using **estwrapper**
commands.

There are several advantages of using **estwrapper** in regard to
dealing directly with `estcmd`, the low-level Hyper Estraier's main
tool:

* **Configuration File**: Your configuration is persisted in a
  configuration file, so you don't have to provide the details on the
  command line.
* **Intelligent and Flexible File Selection**: You define the
  directories to index, file types to exclude from indexing (thus
  improving performance), specific file types to index, and you can
  also exclude files on a per-directory basis.
* **Various Search Methods**: You can use the tool to search from the
  command line, and it provides a convenient interface for integrating
  it with other tools, for example with the Mutt email client.
* **Database Statistics**: You can retrieve various statistics about
  the search database, such as which files are indexed, data of the
  last database update and so on.

**estwrapper** includes two main tools, similar to each other but
slightly different in operation: `straydoc`  which is used for
indexing and searching documents, and `straymail` which is specific
for indexing and searching email messages (stored in Maildir format).

## Installation

You can install **estwrapper** using the following steps:

1. Place the estwrapper scripts `stray_common.sh`, `straydoc`, and
   `straymail` in the same directory, and make sure it is included in
   your PATH environment variable.

2. If you want to use the `estfx_office2txt` filter script provided by
   **estwrapper**, place it together with the other scripts above, or
   add its directory to the filters' path using the configuration
   variable FILTERS_PATH.

3. Create directories for the databases you wish to
   create. Recommended structure is to create a main `~/.estwrapper.d`
   directory that will contain a separate sub-directory for each
   database, as well as the configuration file (see below).
   
   For example, to create one database for your documents and one for
   your email messages it is recommended that you create the following
   directories: the main directory `$HOME/.estwrapper.d`, a directory
   for your documents' index `$HOME/.estwrapper.d/doc_db` and a
   directory for your email messages' index
   `$HOME/.estwrapper.d/mail_db`.
   
   You can create all the three of them with the following single Bash
   command:
   
       mkdir -p ~/.estwrapper.d/{doc,mail}_db
	  
4. Copy the configuration file `estwrapper.conf` to the main
   `~/.estwrapper.d` directory and edit it to fit your needs.
   
   The most important settings are the directories you wish to index
   and the filters settings. Note that if you choose to have the
   database in a location different than what is described in the
   previous section you should also modify the corresponding settings
   in the configuration file.
   
   Here is an example of the settings that you must inspect:
	   
	   # databases location
       DOC_SEARCH_DB="$HOME/.estwrapper.d/doc_db"
       MAIL_SEARCH_DB="$HOME/.estwrapper.d/mail_db"
	   # directories to index
       DOC_DIRS=("$HOME/Documents" "$HOME/Dropbox")
       MAIL_DIRS=("$HOME/Mail/main/INBOX" "$HOME/Mail/main/Sent")

   Another variable that you may want to define is the FILTER_PATH
   which defines the search path for filters. It has the same syntax
   as the syestem's PATH shell variable. For example:

       FILTER_PATH=$HOME/bin/filters:$HOME/bin

By this the installation is complete, except for possible fine
tuning. Assuming you have already installed Hyper Estraier and
possibly the utilities required for the [filters](#filters) you
configured, you can now run either `straydoc` for indexing your
documents or `straymail` for indexing your email messages.

### Configuration

System's configuration is read from configuration file that is
searched for in the following locations, in that order:

1. ~/.estwrapper.d/estwrapper.conf
2. ~/.estwrapper.conf
3. /etc/estwrapper.conf

It is also possible to specify a different file using the `-f` command
line option.

The configuration settings include:

* The directory in which the database is stored;
* List of file types to ignore (e.g., image files);
* List of file types to index;
* [Filter](#filters) definitions.

The configuration file is documented, look at it for additional
information regarding configuration options.

### Filters

Hyper Estraier can process directly only text and HTML files. In order
to process files of different types they need to be first converted to
either of these types. Hyper Estraier can convert files on the fly and
process them, provided you supply it with an appropriate 'filter' for
the file type you want it to process and instruct it to use it using
command line options.

**estwrapper** comes with filter script for LibreOffice Writer files
and Microsoft Office doc and docx files, that can be enabled or
disabled using configuration settings. Additionally you can use the
configuration option `USER_FILTERS` in order to set additional filters
(In also worth looking at the filters that come with Hyper Estraier),

Note that the filter script in this package require the following
utilities to be available:

* `pdftotext` for PDF files;
* `odt2txt` for ODT files;
* `catdoc` for DOC files;
* `docx2txt` for  DOCX files;

These tools should be available on most Linux distributions.

## Usage

**Note**: **estwrapper** includes two utilitiesâ€”`straydoc` for
indexing documents and `straymail` for indexing email messages. Aside
for some differences in the [configuration](#configuration) settings
the usage of these two tools is the same. Hence, in the following
sections, I'll use the token `straydoc` to refer to either of these
tools.

### Creating or Updating a database

To create (or update) a search database run `straydoc` with no
option switches or with only a combination of the following options:

* `-f <file>` : select a non-default configuration file. This switch
  can be used in combination of any other switches.
* `-s` : log messages to syslog, instead of printing to stderr.
* `-t` <name> : use `name` to tag log messages, instead of the script
  name.

The list of directories to search, types of files to index, the
location of the database and additional setting will be taken from the
configuration file.

### Viewing database information

To view different types of information about an existing database run
`straydoc` with any combination of the switches below:

* `-h` : print usage information.
* `-B` : view the log of the last database build.
* `-I` : print brief database information.
* `-l` : list all the files that would be scanned and indexed. Useful
  for tuning the configuration filters.
* `-L` : list all files registered with the database.

### Searching the database

* `-H <phrase>` : search for phrase; print results to stdout in human-readable format.
* `-S <phrase>` : search for phrase; create symbolic links files that
  are found in a directory specified in the configuration file.
* `-P` : similar to `-S`, but the user is prompted for the search phrase.

See the following section for more details.

## Searching Methods in detail

### Searching from the command line

You can search your documents from the command line with the following
command:

    straydoc -H some-search-pharse
	
the results will be printed to the standard output.

You can also use the command slightly differently:

    straydoc -S some-search-pharse

in which case a symbolic link for each file found will be created in
the directory defined by the `DOC_RESULTS` configuration variable. (if
you would use `straymail`. the links will be created in
`MAIL_RESULTS`.)

Another option is to use:

	straydoc -M
	
This works similarly to the `-S` option, the only differently is that
the user is prompted for the search phrase instead of having to
provide it in advance. This option might be useful when `straymail`
(or `straydoc`) is called by another tool and needs to be interactive.


Note:
See [Hyper Estraier User's Guide](http://fallabs.com/hyperestraier/uguide-en.html)
for detailed information on the syntax of search phrases.

### Searching using a Web Interface

Hyper Estraier provides a CGI script that you can use to search the
index using a web interface, that you can run using a local web
server. This interface is documented in the
[Hyper Estraier User's Guide](http://fallabs.com/hyperestraier/uguide-en.html).

However, in short, this is what one needs to do:

1. Locate the files `estseek.cgi`, `estseek.conf`, `estseek.help`, `estseek.tmpl`
   and `estseek.top`, and copy them to your CGI director;
2. Edit `estseek.conf`, and modify the `indexname` variable to point
   to your index database directory. This should be a directory named
   `est_db`, located under the directory specified by the
   `DOC_SEARCH_DB` configuration variable (for searching your email
   index this would be `MAIL_SEARCH_DB`);
3. Point your browser to the CGI script and start searching.

#### Open Files by local URLs

As a side note, some browsers won't open, by default, local files
pointed to by URLs found on web pages for security reasons. This
behavior won't let you open the files found by the search directly
from the browser.

In Firefox you can workaround this by modifying the browser's
configuration, using the following instructions:

Close all instances of Firefox, then open
~/.mozilla/firefox/<profile_name>/prefs.js in your favorite editor,
and add the following lines:

	user_pref("capability.policy.localfilelinks.checkloaduri.enabled", "allAccess");
	user_pref("capability.policy.localfilelinks.sites", "http://localhost http://127.0.0.1");
	user_pref("capability.policy.policynames", "localfilelinks");

Another option is to use an add-on such as
[LocalLink](http://locallink.mozdev.org/) or similar.

### Searching email messages from within Mutt

You can use `straymail` to search email messages from within Mutt
assuming your emails are stored locally in Maildir format.

The idea is as follows:

A Mutt's macro calls `straymail -P`. The user is then prompted for a
search pharse, and after providing it and pressing `Enter`,
`straymail` searches the index and creates symbolic links for the files
found in a special directory. The user can use Mutt to browse this
directory and read the email messages it contains.

Here is an example for such a macro:

    macro generic,index,pager <f6> "<shell-escape>straymail -P<enter>\
    <change-folder><kill-line>=search-results<enter>" \
    "search with Hyper Estraier"

Note that this macro, after invoking `straymail`, changes the mail
folder to `=search-results`, which is a directory named
`search-results` relative to Mutt's `folder`, the default location of
mailboxes.

Also note that the only detail which is dependent on Mail User
Agent's specifics is the ability to run macros, so in principle it should be
possible to apply this technique to other MUAs as well.
